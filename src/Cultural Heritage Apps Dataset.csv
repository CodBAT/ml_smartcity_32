Explorer provides turn-by-turn directions from any location, from the edge of the universe to the age of the dinosaurs, plus the shortest route to restrooms, shops, cafes, and exits.How does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.The Museum’s free AMNH-Guest Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.NOTE: Bluetooth must be turned on for full functionality.

Bei einigen Objekten muss man genau hinsehen, bei anderen auch hinhören. Einige lassen die Figuren aus dem Rahmen tanzen, andere zeigen Dir wie sich komplexe Muster und Strukturen zusammensetzen.Features– übersichtliche Liste aller interaktiven Objekte– Verortung der Objekte im Museum in Form eines interaktiven Raumplans– Hintergrundinfos zu den Objekten– Screenshot- und SharingfunktionÜber das ProjektTAMAM ist ein Projekt, das mehrere Moscheen und das Museum für Islamische Kunst zusammen durchführen. In diesem Rahmen wird Unterrichtsmaterial für die Kulturelle Bildung in Moscheegemeinden entwickelt. Damit werden Bildungsakteure vernetzt, die bisher nur wenig miteinander kooperiert haben. Durch partizipatives Arbeiten sind die teilnehmenden Multiplikatorinnen und Multiplikatoren nachhaltig in den Entwicklungsprozess eingebunden.Ausgangspunkt des Unterrichtsmaterials sind die Kunstwerke im Museum für Islamische Kunst. Die Kernaussage, die mit dem Material transportiert wird, lautet: „Gemeinsame Vergangenheit - gemeinsame Zukunft“. Denn alle Kunstwerke erzählen spannende Geschichten von interkulturellem Austausch und transregionalen Bezügen. Die Entstehung der Objekte kam erst dadurch zu Stande, dass Menschen, Ideen und Objekte gewandert sind und in regem Austausch standen. In der Kunstgeschichte wird klar: Der Kontakt und die gegenseitige Bereicherung verschiedener Ethnien, Kulturen und Religionen hat Kunstwerke von dieser Qualität ermöglicht. Diese Botschaft holen wir in die Gegenwart und kombinieren sie mit der Alltagserfahrung junger Musliminnen und Muslime in Deutschland. Die Objekte des Museums werden dadurch zum Medium für eine Bildungsarbeit, die mit der Kunst aktuelle gesellschaftliche Prozesse von hoher Relevanz begleitet. Unterstützt werden die Unterrichtsmaterialien von verschiedenen neuen Medien, wie der TAMAM-App, die Du Dir hier runterladen kannst.Mehr über das TAMAM-Projekt erfährst Du auf www.tamam-projekt.de. Dort findest Du nach und nach auch das gesamte Unterrichtsmaterial.With this app you bring to life the collection of the Museum of Islamic Art and the TAMAM materials. Selected works can be scanned with the app and digitally expanded in Augmented Reality.Pay attention to markings in the museum or orient yourself on the room plan in the app menu. For some objects, you have to look closely and listen to others. Some let the figures dance out of the frame, others show you how complex patterns and structures are put together.features- clear list of all interactive objects- Location of the objects in the museum in the form of an interactive spatial plan- Background information about the objects- Screenshot and sharing functionabout the projectTAMAM is a project that involves several mosques and the Museum of Islamic Art together. Within this framework, educational materials for cultural education in mosque communities will be developed. This links education players who have previously had little cooperation with each other. Through participatory work, the participating multipliers are sustainably involved in the development process.The starting point of the teaching material are the works of art in the Museum of Islamic Art. The key message conveyed by the material is ""Common past - common future"". Because all works of art tell exciting stories of intercultural exchange and transregional references. The emergence of the objects came about only when people, ideas and objects wandered and were in lively exchange. In art history, it becomes clear that the contact and the mutual enrichment of different ethnic groups, cultures and religions has enabled works of art of this quality.

Welcoming visitors from all over the world, it is the only museum in the United States dedicated to an internationally-known woman artist. One of the most significant artists of the 20th century, Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986) was devoted to creating imagery that expressed what she called “the wideness and wonder of the world as I live in it.” She was a leading member of the Stieglitz Circle artists, headed by Alfred Stieglitz, America’s first advocate of modern art in America.  These avant-garde artists began to flourish in New York in the 1910s. O’Keeffe’s images—instantly recognizable as her own —include abstractions, large-scale depictions of flowers, leaves, rocks, shells, bones and other natural forms, New York cityscapes and paintings of the unusual shapes and colors of architectural and landscape forms of northern New Mexico.The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum is the largest single repository of O'Keeffe's work in the world.

Today, the museum´s art collection contains art works by children and young from more than 180 countries.The Museum was established in 1986 by The Foundation of Children's History, Art and Culture. Film director Rafael Goldin (1920-1994) and his wife, Doctor of Medicine, Alla Goldin (1938-2007), have conceived and developed the idea of this unique Museum and collection.At Lille Frøens vei in Oslo you can see the world through children's eyes and understand how children's art is a bearer of aesthetic values. The Museum regards children's art as a living part of folk art and also as an important element in our national and universal culture. The children's own opinion and concerns are presented through changing thematic exhibitions, carefully chosen with the same demands for quality as in an adults art museum.The main goal is to promote «the Rights of the Child» and in the future also serve as a research centre for the study of the history, art and culture of the child. The museum is beneficial to children as well as to adults and the collection is intended as a source of inspiration to both children and adults - including artists, pedagogues, researchers and politicians. Our longterm efforts are to develop appreciation of the value of children's art and culture represent, at the same time, a struggle to protect the rights of the child. The right to have and preserve a culture of one's own is an accepted principle, when referring to nations or segments of the population. In addition to aesthetic qualities, the Museum contributes to provide a better understanding of children's visions and standards of value.It is said that children are people. But, people do not exist without a culture. Children are people who belong to the future. And they have the right to their own culture, their own art and history. - Founder & Film director Rafael Goldin (1920-1994)Read moreCollapse",2041.00,0.00,Without Review,14.00,29/06/2015,19/03/2021,2090.00,2.90,100.00,4.30,,,,,,,,,,,

It was rebranded in early 2014 following a major investment project.Situated on the site of the old Kew Bridge Pumping Station in Brentford, near Kew Bridge on the River Thames in West London, England, the museum is centred on a collection of stationary water pumping steam engines dating from 1820 to 1910. It is the home of the world’s largest collection of working Cornish engines, including the Grand Junction 90 inch, the largest such engine in the world. The site is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).Kew Bridge Pumping Station was originally opened in 1838 by the Grand Junction Waterworks Company, following a decision to close an earlier pumping station at Chelsea due to poor water quality. In the years up to 1944 the site expanded, ultimately housing six steam pumping engines as well as four Allen diesel pumps and four electric pump sets. The steam engines were retired from service in 1944, although two were kept on standby until 1958, when a demonstration run of the Harvey & Co. 100 inch engine marked the final time steam power would pump drinking water at the site.The Metropolitan Water Board decided not to scrap the resident steam pumping engines and set them aside to form the basis of a museum display at a later date. This action bore fruit in 1974 with the formation of the Kew Bridge Engines Trust, a registered charity, by a group of volunteers previously involved in the restoration of the Crofton Pumping Station.Today the site is an internationally recognised museum of working steam pumping engines, a reminder of the many pumping stations spread throughout London and the UK. In 1999, the United Kingdom government Department for Culture, Media and Sport described Kew Bridge as ""the most important historic site of the water supply industry in Britain"".The Kew Bridge Engine Trust and Water Supply Museum Limited, a registered charity, has three aims:1) to restore (and maintain) the five historic beam engines at the Kew Bridge site2) to add other important water pumping engines3) to establish a museum of London's water supply.In 1997 the museum was awarded an Engineering Heritage Award by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Britain’s Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). A second IMechE Engineering Hallmark was awarded in 2008 for the restoration of the Bull engine, making the museum one of only 12 sites to achieve more than one of these awards.Read moreCollapse",2742.00,0.00,Without Review,14.00,02/03/2018,19/03/2021,1113.00,23.00,10.00,7.00,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus his residence became a museum, the museum that you are visiting today, and his wealth served to acquire, over more than a century, the extensive collection of paintings and sculptures that make up the modern art gallery.In order to display the collection, in 1963 the architect Carlo Scarpa renewed the building that stands next to the museum, known as Palazzo Brunner. The external façades remained unchanged, but the interior was redesigned to create vast linear spaces that contrasted with the museum’s 19th century appearance. Scarpa created a passageway that connected the two buildings, so that the second floor of the main residence would be joined to the third floor of the modern art gallery, a leap in time over a distance of just a few feet.To view all content the user needs to insert the code he was given when purchasing the ticket.Read moreCollapse",1861.00,0.00,Without Review,14.00,09/11/2016,19/03/2021,1591.00,6.70,1000.00,4.10,,,,,,,,,,,
